# monarch_situational_awareness

This repository hosts the public version of the MOnarCH Situational Awareness Module (SAM).
SAM was developed in the context of the MOnarCH FP-7 project (http://monarch-fp7.eu/), with the goal
of managing the communication in a networked robot system, and to act as an interface between software modules
from the various project partners, supporting their deployment, and allowing system-wide communication properties to be 
ensured and visualized in real-time.

Check the Wiki of this repository for technical details of how to deploy / use SAM.
